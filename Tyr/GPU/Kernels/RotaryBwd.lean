  Compatibility import for the working rotary forward/backward kernels.

  The former `rotaryBwd` definition in this module allocated conceptual
  register/shared tiles but never loaded global inputs or wrote the output.
  Keeping that GPU entrypoint would silently expose a no-op backward pass.
  The measured BF16 D64 implementation is
  `Rotary.rotaryBwdQKD64Bf16Direct` in `Rotary.lean`.
