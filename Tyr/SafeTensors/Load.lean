  Tyr/SafeTensors/Load.lean

  Shared checkpoint-loading helpers used by the per-model `Weights`
  modules. Centralizes the try-load and candidate-name fallback patterns
  needed when reading Hugging Face SafeTensors checkpoints (single-file
  and sharded), so model families don't re-implement them.
